# OCaml - Functional Programming

This repository contains OCaml projects exploring functional programming concepts. OCaml is a powerful, multi-paradigm programming language that emphasizes functional programming with strong static typing, type inference, and immutability. It's particularly well-suited for symbolic computation, formal verification, and building robust software systems.
