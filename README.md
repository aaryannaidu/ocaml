# OCaml - Functional Programming

This repository contains OCaml projects exploring functional programming concepts. OCaml is a powerful, multi-paradigm programming language that emphasizes functional programming with strong static typing, type inference, and immutability. It's particularly well-suited for symbolic computation, formal verification, and building robust software systems.

## Projects

### [Sudoku Solver](./suduko_solver)
A SAT-based Sudoku solver implementation that converts Sudoku puzzles to CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) and uses SAT solving techniques to find solutions.

### [Automated Theorem Proving](./abstarct_syntax)
An implementation of first-order logic abstract syntax trees, including support for signatures, complex expressions, substitutions (composition and in-place), and predicate logic formulas.
